          "A few years ago, mobile development technology has been quickly growing, and it has also been an emerging trend. Furthermore, different smartphones use diverse operating systems, which support different programming languages. Therefore, developing native applications individually for each platform turns out to be an arduous and expensive effort to undertake. The concept of “write once, deploy everywhere”, will massively reduce the cost of creating, maintaining and versioning mobile applications. In this paper, we suggest the automatic MDA (Model Driven Architecture) transformations to develop embedded heterogeneous software. Then we present our works in terms of defining a new target platform independent model (PIM), and the transformation rules for generating native code for such applications. Thus, we singled out domain specific language (DSL), in order to increase the productivity of software …",

This requires specific knowledge and experience to successfully operate all features. The heterogeneity development tools and languages in mobile apps makes difficult to develop multi-platform mobile applications. Thus, it requires developers to make a choice on the platform, while ensuring the widest possible dissemination. The strategy "write once, deploy anywhere" is a smart way to develop mobile applications. In fact, it equips developers with what they need to keep ahead of the game. The aim of this work is to define an independent language of the platform then generate native code for iOS applications using an MDA approach.

          "In the old days, networking in Android was a nightmare. Nowadays the problem is to find out which solution fits better the project's necessities. Therefore, almost every Android applications use a Web REST API for data transfer. Previously, developers preferred to write their own code to retrieve and analyze data. However, they now have a whole range of REST client libraries, which can speed up development by reducing the coding efforts, and efficiently analyze data. The REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the most commonly used way for creating, publishing, and consuming Web services, exploiting JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as a data exchange format. Android Volley and Retrofit are the most used libraries for accessing the REST Web APIs today. In this paper, we will present a comparative study between these two libraries, in order to disclose the advantages and limitations of each of …",

As a result of this incremental mobile innovation, new software engineering techniques, software documentation, and tools adapted to the mobile platform remain essential in order to help developers to better understand, analyze, and bootstrap porting mobile applications. In this paper, the authors propose a model-driven reverse-engineering approach based on static analysis, which describes a semantic metamodel of the iOS mobile application and extract design information (such as user interfaces, activity diagram, entities, framework and library dependencies) in order to generate the functional specification documentation and the Android UI skeleton. Thus, aiding the project team, who has in charge porting the app to another mobile platform, to agree upon a consensus on what has to be implemented and safe development cost by auto generating the Android UI skeleton project. To experiment this approach, the authors have implemented a tool called iSpecSnapshot. Moreover, they evaluate the performance of iSpecSnapshot by an experiment involving iOS applications that are ported to Android platform.",

L’Ingénierie Des Modèles (IDM) ou Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) combiné avec UML, comme cela a été déjà adopté dans le génie logiciel, pourrait fournir une abstraction et une automatisation pour les développeurs de logiciels mobiles. Pour appuyer cela, des outils et des approches adéquates sont nécessaires. Ce projet de thèse présente une approche MDE pour le développement des applications mobiles, qui inclut la modélisation avec un langage dédié, la modélisation UML et la génération de code afin de faciliter et d'accélérer le développement des applications mobiles.
